# PRACTICE QUESTIONS

#1. Declare two variables, 'x' and 'y', and assign tem integer values.
   Swap the vales
x = 10
y = 20

print ("Before swapping")
print ("x=",x,"y=",y)
x = x+y
y = x-y
x = x-y 

print ()
print ("After swapping")
print ("x=",x,"y=",y)

#2 Area of a rectangle

a = int(input("a = "))
b = int(input("b = "))
area = a*b
print ("Area = ",area)

#3 Convert Temp from Celsius to Fahrenheit

cel = int(input("Temperature in Celsius = "))

fah = (cel*9/5) + 32
print ("Fahrenheit = ",fah)
